### 2.23.1 ###

* Restore the explicit Mongoid generator and add a test to ensure we don't break objects that have an attributes property that isn't a mass assignment setter. (#19)
* Install `rubocop-performance` and address some small performance issues (!12)

### 2.23.0 ###

* Leverage `#attributes=` when setting attributes in base generator if it exists.
* Remove Mongoid generator in favor of the aforementioned tweak to the base generator. This does not impact Mongoid Support. (#14)
* Leverage ActiveSupport's camelize to produce class names if it exists (#15)

### 2.22.0 ###

* Lots of small improvements to the codebase
* Dropped support for ruby versions no longer officially supported (2.4 and below)
* Dropped support for rails versions no longer officially supported (5.1 and below)
* Dropped support for mongoid versions relying on unsupported active_model versions (5 and below)

### 2.21.1 ###

* Fix bug where nil property overrides could be ignored (#318)

### 2.21.0 ###

* Add support for rails 6
* Add support for sequel 5

* Drop support for mongoid versions relying on unsupported active_model versions (3.1 and below)
* Drop support for ruby versions no longer officially supported (2.3 and below)
* Correctly generate fabricators inside rails engine namespaces (#315)

### 2.20.2 ###

* Fix for applications with a phony ActiveRecord module declared (#312)

### 2.20.1 ###

* Make #klass public so the `rake fabrication:list` works properly (#307)
* Fix a bug preventing default expansions from singularizing when using `rand` option (#309)

### 2.20.0 ###

* Allow passing a range to rand (#292, #308)

Now you can pass a range in as the `rand` option to get a random number of related objects. For example, to get a random number of `wockets` between 5 and 9 you could do this:

```
Fabricate(:widget) do
  wockets(rand: 5..9)
end
```

### 2.19.0 ###

* Raise an error when a Sequel model fails to validate (#306)

This is already how ActiveRecord models work within fabrication. If you are running Sequel and encounter errors after upgrading it is because these models were silently failing either in validation or callbacks. Raising errors in these cases will help you improve reliability of your tests.

### 2.18.0 ###

* Raise an error when fabrication detects a potentially infinite recursive build (#305)

If you've set up fabricators that recursively call each other you may see an error like this:

```
You appear to have infinite recursion with the `user` fabricator
```

Your suite may even have been "working properly" before (one of mine was) but this error is now happening. Good news! You can improve the speed of your test suite AND avoid potential errors with a simple change.

It's likely you have a scenario like this in the fabricator named by the error message.

```
Fabricator(:user) do
  sessions(count: 1)
end

Fabricator(:session) do
  user
end
```

If you change the `user` fabricator to build with a nil inverse relationship all will be well again.

```
Fabricator(:user) do
  sessions(count: 1) { Fabricate.build(:session, user: nil) }
end
```

If you have any problems please email the google group and I'll help get you sorted. (fabricationgem@googlegroups.com)
